# How to run the app
### Obs.: if you don't want to run the app locally and just want to see it working, go to the preview section just below this one
Now, if you do want to run the app locally, you need to have Flutter SDK installed on your machine. If you don't, head over to the [official installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

After installing Flutter SDK, follow these steps in order to run the application successfully:
1. Clone this repository or download the source code as ``.zip``
2. On the root folder of the project, run the following command to download the project dependencies: ``flutter pub get``
3. Now that you've downloaded the dependencies, the application is ready to go. Just run it with the following command: ``flutter run``

Note: for the third step, you need to have an AVD (Android Virtual Device) running on your machine, or a physical device connected via USB with debug permissions.
If you don't have any of these, here are some links on [how to set up and run an AVD](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) or [grant debug permission on a physical device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device).
